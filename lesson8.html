The State Fair is the best fiar in the state according to most people, for exanple The Iowa State Fair is two weeks long and generally has 100,000 attendees a day.(Iowa has about 2 mllion people)
Many people enjoy camping at the fair all week. Although such a long stay costs a small fortune. In my opinion the state fair is a nice place to spend day, but not a week.
